sitestatus.py is a Python script that reflects curl statistics in a fascinating and well-defined way, it is a single file which is compatible with Python 3 and requires no additional software (dependencies) to be installed on a users system.

It is fundamentally a wrapper of cURL tool, means that you can use several valid cURL options after a URL(s), excluding the options -w, -D, -o, -s, and -S, which are already employed by httpstat.
